For this second-week assignment, we were asked to complete a 5-Part Scrapy Beginner Guide Series, where we are to build a Scrapy project and-to-end from building the scrapers to deploying on a server and running them every day.

Unfortunately, I got stuck on Part 1 of this assignment and was unable to complete it.
