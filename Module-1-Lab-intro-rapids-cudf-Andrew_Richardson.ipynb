Bonus: One-Hot Encoding\n","Now that you have looked at a few functionalities provided by RAPIDS, let us go a step further. In general, several applications in Machine Learning use One-hot encoding to convert categorical, non-numerical data into numerical values that the model can use. These encodings represent data as a vector of 0s and 1s, which help analyse data better. Here, let us try to encode the type of the title, i.e., a movie or a TV show into one-hot encodings.\n","\n","<B> Note: cuDF contains a one-hot-encoding function that you can use.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"dER9PRwbDBCK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715471510986,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":155,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Richardson","userId":"06657971681276283010"}}},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"H9ABYgzsCy_w","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":211},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1715473305274,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":173,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Richardson","userId":"06657971681276283010"}},"outputId":"20eca74a-b7ce-44c3-908e-0ecdb032616c"},"source":["#convert column of dataframe from series to an array\n","record_title = gdf['title'].to_array()\n","record_type = gdf['type'].to_array()\n","\n","#create pandas df with corresponding attributes\n","movie_df = pd.DataFrame({'record_title': record_title, 'record_type': record_type})\n","movie_df.record_type = movie_df.record_type.astype('category')\n","\n","#7\n","#step 1: Convert the dataframe to cudf\n","movie_cudf = cudf.DataFrame.from_pandas(movie_df)\n","\n","#step 2: Create a column called record_codes with the numerically encoded values\n","movie_cudf['record_codes'] = movie_cudf['record_type'].cat.codes\n","\n","#step 3: Identify the unique codes\n","unique_codes = movie_cudf['record_codes'].unique()\n","\n","#step 4:\n","encoded_df = cudf.get_dummies(movie_cudf['record_type'])\n","\n","encoded_df"],"execution_count":102,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"AttributeError","evalue":"'Series' object has no attribute 'to_array'","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mAttributeError\u001b[0m                            Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-102-e46c7c4ffeeb>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 2>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#convert column of dataframe from series to an array\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 2\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mrecord_title\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mgdf\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'title'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mto_array\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0mrecord_type\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mgdf\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'type'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mto_array\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#create pandas df with corresponding attributes\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mAttributeError\u001b[0m: 'Series' object has no attribute 'to_array'"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","record_title = gdf['title'].to_pandas()\n","record_type = gdf['type'].to_pandas()\n","\n","# Create pandas DataFrame with corresponding attributes\n","movie_df = pd.DataFrame({'record_title': record_title, 'record_type': record_type})\n","movie_df['record_type'] = movie_df['record_type'].astype('category')\n","\n","# Convert pandas DataFrame to cudf DataFrame\n","movie_cudf = cudf.DataFrame.from_pandas(movie_df)\n","\n","# Create a column called 'record_codes' with numerically encoded values\n","movie_cudf['record_codes'] = movie_cudf['record_type'].cat.codes\n","\n","# Identify the unique codes\n","unique_codes = movie_cudf['record_codes'].unique()\n","\n","# Create an encoded DataFrame representing the type of each record\n","encoded_df = cudf.get_dummies(movie_cudf['record_type'])\n","\n","# Display the encoded DataFrame\n","print(encoded_df)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SW3PHzVnFcq6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715473283435,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":169,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Richardson","userId":"06657971681276283010"}},"outputId":"f07b811d-5189-4281-9550-2f4771979314"},"execution_count":100,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["      Movie  TV Show\n","0      True    False\n","1     False     True\n","2     False     True\n","3     False     True\n","4     False     True\n","...     ...      ...\n","8802   True    False\n","8803  False     True\n","8804   True    False\n","8805   True    False\n","8806   True    False\n","\n","[8807 rows x 2 columns]\n"]}]}]}
